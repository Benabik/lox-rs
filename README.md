This is a Rust solution-in-progress to the ["Build your own Interpreter"
Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this challenge you'll build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, you'll learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.

I was inspired to work on this by [Jon Gjengset's stream of this challenge](https://github.com/jonhoo/lox)
